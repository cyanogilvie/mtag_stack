MTAG_STACK
==========

This tiny library provides a data structure for efficiently building and
resolving a trie of int64_t offsets.  The motivation is to provide an mtag
implementation compatible with re2c that is as performant as possible (low
allocation load, low stack mem usage, good cache locality).
